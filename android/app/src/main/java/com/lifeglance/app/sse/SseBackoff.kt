/**
 * Capped exponential backoff with a stability reset — the Kotlin mirror of the
 * reconnect policy in `createVaultEventClient` (src/sync/vaultEventStream.js).
 * Ported from dayGLANCE's production reader (dayglance-android sse/SseBackoff.kt).
 *
 * A connection that stays open at least [minStableMs] is treated as healthy and
 * resets the attempt counter, so a genuine long-lived stream that finally drops
 * reconnects promptly. A connection that opens then drops immediately (a flap —
 * server closing fast, proxy timeout, network reset) keeps backing off, up to
 * [maxMs], so a broken endpoint can never storm the vault with reconnects.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, so it is unit-testable with no clock or network.
