/**
 * Incremental Server-Sent-Events frame boundary detector — the Kotlin mirror of
 * the renderer's `drainSseBuffer` (src/sync/vaultEventStream.js). Ported from
 * dayGLANCE's production reader (dayglance-android sse/SseFraming.kt).
 *
 * It does ONLY transport-level framing: accumulate stream text across reads, split
 * complete event blocks on the blank-line delimiter, and hand each block back
 * verbatim. It deliberately does NOT parse the `{seq}` nudge — that extraction
 * stays in the renderer's single `parseSseFrame`, which this shell feeds each
 * block through via the plugin event. Keeping ONE nudge parser (in the renderer)
 * is the whole point of the bridge-fed design: the native side is a dumb, robust
 * byte framer.
 *
 * Stateful per instance (holds the partial-block remainder between reads) and pure
 * otherwise, so it is unit-testable with no network.
