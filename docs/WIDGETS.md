# Native Widgets — Plan & Status

Living document for lifeGLANCE's native home-screen widgets (Android first, iOS to
follow). Captures the architecture, what's built, and the roadmap so work can resume
cleanly across sessions.

## The core constraint

lifeGLANCE is a **Capacitor app** — a React PWA in a WebView with a thin native
shell. **All data lives in IndexedDB inside the WebView**, which a widget's process
**cannot read**. So every widget depends on a **data bridge**: the web app pushes a
compact, render-ready snapshot into native `SharedPreferences`, and the widget reads
from there. This bridge is the foundation; the widgets themselves are comparatively
small once it exists.

## Architecture

```
React app (IndexedDB)                         Native (Android)
─────────────────────                         ────────────────
buildWidgetSnapshot()  ──push (debounced)──▶  WidgetBridgePlugin
  src/utils/widgetSnapshot.js                   → SharedPreferences("lifeglance_widget")
  src/native/widgetBridge.js                    → broadcast APPWIDGET_UPDATE
  hook in src/App.jsx                                    │
                                                         ▼
widget tap ◀──consumeLaunchTarget()──         NextMilestoneWidget (Glance)
  TimelineView focuses milestone                reads snapshot, renders, taps deep-link
                                              WidgetRefreshWorker (midnight tick)
```

### Snapshot schema (`buildWidgetSnapshot`)

Pure, unit-tested function. Reuses existing recurrence-collapse
(`applyRecurFilter('next')`) and **main-timeline visibility** logic, so hidden or
duplicated recurring milestones never surface. **Dates are stored as raw ISO** — the
widget computes relative labels ("in 12 days") itself at render time, because the
snapshot can be stale and those labels roll over at midnight.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "generatedAt": "ISO",
  "birthday": "ISO | null",
  "next": { "id", "title", "date", "datePrecision", "category", "color" } | null,
  "prev": { ...same... } | null,                 // most recently passed
  "currentChapter": {
    "id", "title", "start", "end", "color",
    "passedCount", "totalCount"                   // member milestones
  } | null,
  "counts": { "past", "future", "total" }
}
```

The schema already carries `prev` and `currentChapter` so the Today and Current
Chapter widgets are **drop-in** later with no bridge changes.

### Refresh strategy

Relative labels are date-sensitive, so a single update source isn't enough:

- **Immediate** — web app pushes on data change (debounced ~1s) and on backgrounding
  (`visibilitychange`).
- **Daily** — `WidgetRefreshWorker` (WorkManager) re-renders at local midnight so
  countdowns roll over even when the app is never opened; each run re-schedules the next.
- **Backstop** — placed widgets render from the last stored snapshot, which survives
  reboot (SharedPreferences persists).

Both the plugin and the worker refresh via the same `ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE`
broadcast, which makes the Glance receiver recompose and re-read the snapshot.

### Deep-linking (widget tap → milestone)

Tap launches `MainActivity` with the milestone id as a Glance ActionParameter
(surfaced as an Intent extra keyed `widget_milestone_id`). `MainActivity` stashes it
in `SharedPreferences`; on resume the web layer calls `consumeLaunchTarget()` and
`TimelineView` centers + opens that milestone.

### Build setup

Adds **Kotlin + Compose + Jetpack Glance** to the previously Java-only Android module.
Kotlin/Java JVM targets aligned to **21** (Capacitor forces Java 21). `java.time` used
for date math via **core library desugaring** (minSdk 24). Versions in
`android/variables.gradle` (`kotlinVersion`, `glanceVersion`).

## Status

### ✅ Phase 1 — Data bridge
- `src/utils/widgetSnapshot.js` (+ `widgetSnapshot.test.js`, 9 tests)
- `src/native/widgetBridge.js`, `WidgetBridgePlugin.java`
- `App.jsx` push hook; `MainActivity.java` plugin registration + deep-link handoff
- `TimelineView.jsx` consumes launch target

### ✅ Phase 2 — Next Milestone widget
- `NextMilestoneWidget.kt` (Glance, dark/amber/monospace, responsive compact + tall)
- `WidgetRefreshWorker.kt` (midnight tick)
- Manifest receiver + `res/xml/next_milestone_widget_info.xml`

Shipped in PR #166 (merged). Glance API fixes in PR #167.

### ✅ Phase 3 — Today + Current Chapter widgets
- `TodayWidget.kt` — weekday, date, age; larger size adds prev/next milestones and the
  current chapter name. Branches on `LocalSize`.
- `CurrentChapterWidget.kt` — active chapter name, elapsed time "in" the chapter, and
  milestones passed/total. **Bounded** chapters show a time-elapsed progress bar;
  **ongoing** chapters (no end) show elapsed time only.
- `WidgetData` extended: full `currentChapter` + `birthday` parsing, and helpers
  (`age`, `durationWords`, `progressFraction`, `weekday`/`todayLong`). New
  `WidgetData.refreshAll()` broadcasts to **all** widget receivers; the bridge plugin
  and midnight worker now call it so every widget refreshes together.
- `WidgetTheme.kt` shared palette; two new manifest receivers + provider XML + strings.
- No snapshot/bridge schema change — the existing snapshot already carried this data.

> ⚠️ The Gradle/Kotlin compile cannot run in the Claude Code sandbox (Maven/Google
> repos blocked). The native module must be built locally (`npm run android`).

### 🚧 Phase 4 — iOS widgets (code complete; Xcode wiring pending)
WidgetKit + SwiftUI port of all three widgets, reusing the same `widgetSnapshot.js`
output. The app↔widget link uses an **App Group** (`group.com.lifeglance`) instead of
Android's same-process SharedPreferences; everything else mirrors Android.
- `ios/App/LifeGlanceWidgets/` — model+store (`WidgetModel.swift`), theme, provider,
  views, `@main` bundle, Info.plist, entitlements.
- `ios/App/App/` — `WidgetBridgePlugin.swift` (iOS `WidgetBridge`), `App.entitlements`,
  `AppDelegate` deep-link parse, `Info.plist` `lifeglance` URL scheme.
- No JS changes — same plugin name and snapshot.

> ⚠️ Creating the Widget Extension target + App Group can't be scripted without risking
> `project.pbxproj`. **See [`IOS-WIDGETS.md`](IOS-WIDGETS.md) for the one-time Xcode
> setup.** Swift can't be compiled in the Claude Code sandbox either.

### ✅ Phase 5 — On This Day + Milestones (stats) widgets
Both platforms. **No new native targets** — Android auto-compiles new `.kt` files; the
iOS widgets are new structs added to the existing extension files. So these land with
just a pull + rebuild.
- **On This Day** — past milestones sharing today's month/day (mirrors `OnThisDayModal`),
  with "N years ago · date". Shows more rows as the widget grows.
- **Milestones (stats)** — total with a past/ahead split, plus this-year count and age
  at the larger size.
- Snapshot gained `onThisDay` and `counts.thisYear`. `onThisDay` is the **candidate pool**
  (all past, non-year milestones); each widget filters it to today's month/day at **render
  time**, so the midnight refresh shows the new day without the app re-pushing.

### ✅ Phase 6 — Pinned countdown + Quick add
Both platforms, no new native targets.
- **Pinned countdown** — a countdown to a milestone the user pins **in the app** (a 📌
  toggle in the milestone detail stores `lifeglance-pinned-milestone-id`; the snapshot
  resolves it to `pinned`). This deliberately avoids per-widget configuration (Android
  config Activity / iOS AppIntent) — a single app-side pin is simpler and cross-platform.
- **Quick add** — a launcher widget that opens the app straight into the new-milestone
  sheet. Reuses the launch-target handoff, extended to carry an `action` ("new") alongside
  the existing `milestoneId` (Android intent extra `widget_action`; iOS `lifeglance://new`).

---

## Roadmap

### 💡 Deferred / ideas
- **Mini-timeline strip** — a rendered slice of the timeline around today. Highest
  "wow," hardest (native canvas or a cached bitmap from the web app). Deferred by
  decision.
- **Per-widget configurable pin** — if a single global pin proves limiting, add real
  configurable widgets (Android config Activity / iOS AppIntent) so each placed widget
  can target a different milestone.
