/// Native GLANCEvault SSE reader — the Swift sibling of Android's
/// `VaultSseClient` (android/.../sse/VaultSseClient.kt), ported from dayGLANCE's
/// production reader (dayglance-ios VaultSseBridge.swift). The transport,
/// lifecycle, and terminal-error policy are identical across the three readers —
/// only the renderer delivery differs (a message sink that [VaultSsePlugin]
/// wires to Capacitor's notifyListeners, not a WebView global).
///
/// WHY A NATIVE READER: the WKWebView cannot stream `text/event-stream` — vault
/// HTTP rides the buffered CapacitorHttp path (whole body as one string), and a
/// direct fetch from the capacitor:// app origin to the vault is CORS-blocked.
/// So the SHELL opens the stream: an authenticated `GET {vaultUrl}/events` with
/// the Bearer device token, read incrementally via `URLSession.bytes(for:)`,
/// framed into SSE event blocks, and each block pushed to the renderer. The
/// renderer reuses its EXISTING `parseSseFrame` + coalescer + drains
/// (src/sync/vaultEventStream.js) — this class owns ONLY the socket, its
/// lifecycle, and reconnect. A native HTTP client has no browser origin, so it
/// needs NO vault CORS change. POLLING in the renderer stays the correctness
/// backstop; these pushes only add instant drains on top.
///
/// LIFECYCLE — the reader runs only when BOTH are true: the renderer declared
/// SSE desired ([enable]/[disable]) AND the app is foreground ([setForeground],
/// wired from UIApplication notifications by the plugin). It drops on background
/// and reconnects with capped exponential backoff on any drop. Every transition
/// funnels through reconcile, which starts or cancels the SINGLE reader Task, so
/// there is never more than one connection. On each (re)connect the vault sends
/// its `ready` frame carrying the account's latest seq (`{"seq":N}`); it flows
/// through as a normal frame, so the coalescer reconciles anything missed while
/// disconnected.
